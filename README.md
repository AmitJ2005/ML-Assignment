Project Title
-------------

User Behavior Analysis and Prediction

Description
-----------

This project focuses on analyzing user behavior based on event data (view, cart, purchase) to identify churn patterns and improve retention strategies. Advanced machine learning techniques like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost were employed to predict user actions and offer personalized insights.

Key Features
------------

*   Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including event types, session behaviors, and product categories.
*   Advanced predictive modeling for churn detection and user segmentation.
*   Personalized strategies derived from behavioral insights.
*   Pandas Profiling for initial dataset exploration.

Technologies Used
-----------------

*   Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, XGBoost)
*   EDA tools: Pandas Profiling
*   Machine Learning algorithms: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost


Results
-------

The analysis revealed key patterns in user behavior, such as:

*   Most users performed fewer than 5 events on average.
*   Price distributions showed significant variability across categories.
*   Churn prediction achieved an accuracy of 79% using XGBoost.
